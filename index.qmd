#### A simple simulation model of an urgent and emergency treatment centre

You are using a `simmer` model deployed using `quarto-live`. The model and all data are local to your machine. No data are uploaded to a remote server, and all computation takes place in your browser.

We have developed a computer based tool for managers of a health
clinic for patients with urgent or emergency health problems. The
clinic treats patients with minor trauma, such as impact injuries,
broken bones, strains or cuts, and non-trauma, such minor illnesses. Patients do not require an appointment to attend the clinic. Patients arrive in an ad-hoc manner over the day, but there is a well known pattern of peak and quiet times throughout the day.

The computer tool allows managers to test ways speeding up the clinic
processes and improving patient experience. The computer tool allows
managers to ask question about the physical design and layout of the
clinic, the order in which patients are seen, the diagnostic equipment
needed by patients, and the speed of treatments. For example:

-   “what if we converted a doctors examination room into a room where nurses assess the urgency of the patients needs.”; or

-   “what if the number of patients we treat in the afternoon doubled”.


We call this type of computer model a simulation model. The
simulation model is set-up to initially copy the treatment and processes
of the real health clinic. For example, in the model the number
registration booking clerks, triage rooms, and the time to treat
non-trauma patients would all be based on the numbers collected in the
real world. All of this data is inputted into the model and a base run
of the model is conducted. The model works by generating the arrival of
synthetic patients over a working day. The patients follow the simple
rules the clinic has for caring for them. For example, non-trauma
patients register their details with a booking clerk then wait for to
see a nurse who will determine their level of emergency. After the
model is run managers can view predictions of the performance of the
model. In this study the model predicts waiting times for patients and
the percentage of time that rooms and diagnostic equipment are in use.

The results from the base run of the simulation model are kept. The
managers can then ask their questions and change the data used by the
simulation model to be different from the real world; for example,
adding an additional triage room. We call this type of ‘what-if’ use of
the model an experiment. The model is again run and predictions from the
experiment are compared to the base run to investigate if improvement
has been achieved.

For this study we have included the following experiments:

-   Increasing the number of triage rooms by one;

-   Increasing the examination capacity by one;

-   Increasing the number of cubicles to treat non-trauma patients by one;

-   Combining additional triage and additional examination capacity.
