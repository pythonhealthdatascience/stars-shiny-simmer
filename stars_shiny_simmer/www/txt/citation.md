# Citation

This project is a **work in progress** towards the STARS 2.0 framework.  You are free to use and build on the work in the interim.  For now, if you do adapt pr use this shiny/simmer app we would be very grateful if you would cite the STARS 1.0 framework paper in the Journal of Simulation.
