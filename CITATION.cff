abstract: >

  The materials and methods in this model work towards
  developing the STARS healthcare framework  (Sharing Tools
  and Artifacts for Reproducible Simulations  in
  healthcare). The code and written materials are a work  in
  progress towards STARS version 2.0 (aiming to support 
  both R and Python).  The materials are not currently 
  production ready and are not recommended for use in
  simulation practice at this stage.
